# Sales-Analysis-Goldmine

I showcase how I cleaned and analyzed 12 months of raw sales data using advanced Excel tools and Power BI. 
Through the dashboard, 

* I answer crucial business questions such as
 
## What is the total number of sales?
## What is the average sales per month? 
## What is the monthly revenue?
## What are the key demographics of the customers?
## Which market (country) generated the most sales on average?
## What were the profits by segment?
## When were the best- and worst-selling periods?
## Which products sell best? 
## Which products should the company order more or less of?


* Additionally, I provide insights on how the company can adjust its marketing strategies for VIP and 
  less-engaged customers and whether or not it should acquire new customers and at what cost.
